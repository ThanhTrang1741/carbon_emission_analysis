# CARBON_EMISSION_ANALYSIS
This report aims to analyze carbon emissions to examine the carbon footprint across various industries. We aim to identify sectors with the highest levels of emissions by analyzing them across countries and years, as well as to uncover trends.

Carbon emissions play a crucial role in the environment, accounting for over 75% of global emissions and posing a significant environmental challenge. These emissions contribute to the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, leading to climate change, planetary warming, and involvement in various environmental disasters.

Through this analysis, we hope to gain an understanding of the environmental impact of different industries and contribute to making informed decisions in sustainable development.

**Data Source: Where Our Data Comes From**
Our dataset is compiled from publicly available data from nature.com and encompasses the product carbon footprints (PCF) for various companies. PCFs represent the greenhouse gas emissions associated with specific products, quantified in CO2 (carbon dioxide equivalent).

**Data Structure**
The dataset consists of 4 tables containing information regarding carbon emissions generated during the production of goods.

## 7. Which industry groups has demonstrated the most notable decrease in carbon footprints (PCFs) over time?


**First of all, we have table named "base" that calculates the total carbon footprint per capita for each industry group in a given year and determines the trend (increase, decrease, or stable) based on the change in carbon footprint compared to the previous year**

    SELECT 
      a.*, 
      CASE 
        WHEN a.total_carbon_fp - a.carbon_fp_change > 0 THEN 'increase'
   		   WHEN a.total_carbon_fp - a.carbon_fp_change < 0 THEN 'decrease'
        ELSE 'stable' 
      END AS trend   
      FROM
  		    (SELECT 
        	 ind.industry_group
        	 ,p.year
          ,SUM(p.carbon_footprint_pcf) as total_carbon_fp,
        	 LAG(SUM(p.carbon_footprint_pcf)) OVER (PARTITION BY ind.industry_group ORDER BY p.year) AS carbon_fp_change
    	    FROM 
        	 product_emissions as p
        	LEFT JOIN 
       	 	industry_groups as ind ON p.industry_group_id = ind.id
    	    GROUP BY 
        	 ind.industry_group, p.year
   		    ORDER BY 
        	 ind.industry_group, p.year
 









**The outer query then selects all columns from the "base" table where the industry group is in a subquery that filters industry groups based on the count of trends labeled as "decrease" being less than 3**

**In summary, the query aims to identify industry groups where the trend in carbon footprint is predominantly decreasing and the count of such trends is less than 3**
